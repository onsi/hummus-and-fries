## Method

1. Prepare the Jalapeno-Cream Cheese by combining all ingredients in a bowl and mixing well.  Refrigerate.
1. Prepare the spice mix by combining all ingredients in a bowl and mixing well.  Place in a spice container that you can pour from.

    1. In a cast-iron skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and fry onions until transluscent.
    1. Add mushrooms and cook until soft.
    1. Add garlic, pine nuts, and spice mix.  Stir and cook until fragrant (30s).
    1. Add red wine and simmer until reduced by half.  Set aside.
1. Slice cheddar into 1/4" thick slices.  Set aside.
1. If grilling the burgers, place cast-iron skillet or griddle or preheat the grill to high heat (400ºF+).  If using stove top, preheat cast-iron skillet to high heat.
1. From ground beef into 4oz balls.
1. Place one or two balls on hot skillet.  Press down with two oiled metal spatulas (do not use a burger press).  Until jagged edges form and burger is uniformly thin (~1/4" thick).
