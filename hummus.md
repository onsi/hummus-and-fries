# Fluffy, Creamy, Hummus

My wife Hannah landed on these ratios and I've been tweaking the method ever since.  The goal is creamy _fluffy_ hummus.  It's worth the effort to do this right.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 can of [Trader Joe's Organic chickpeas](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/organic-garbanzo-beans-050261), drained, strained, and **peeled**
- [ ] 1/3 cup [Mid-East Tahini](https://www.amazon.com/EAST-SESAME-SPREAD-TAHINI-PLASTIC/dp/B07FM2N6T8?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=AA9C1GM513EBY)  (stir container well before pouring)
- [ ] 1/4 cup lemon juice (from ~2 freshly squeezed lemons)
- [ ] 1/4 cup olive oil + 2 Tbsp water
- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt (or see below)
- [ ] 1 clove garlic (mashed in wooden [mortar and pestle](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=wooden+mortar+and+pestle&crid=1BUF1A6X31XDC&sprefix=wooden+mortar+and+pestl%2Caps%2C126&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) with 1/2 the salt)

## Method

1. Mash garlic with 1/4 tsp salt.
1. Juice lemons and place lemons and garlic in food processor bowl.  Let them sit for two minutes, the lemon will take the bitter edge off the garlic.
1. Add tahini and remaining 1/4 tsp salt.  Blend for 2 minutes.
1. Add peeled chickpeas, olive oil and water.  Blend for 20 minutes.
1. Transfer to tupperware and refrigerate.
1. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and/or my [meaty hummus topping](hummus-topping.md).

## FAQ

#### Why peel the chickpeas?

The goal is creamy, fluffy, hummus.  All that fiber in the skins contributes to grainy hummus.  Get rid of it.

#### How do you peel the chickpeas?

I follow these steps:

1. Pick something brainless to watch on a TV or iPad.
2. Open the can of chickpeas and strain in a colander.  Rinse chickpeas.
3. Place colander on towel.
4. Place a bowl to deposit peels.
5. Take one chickpea, pinch it gently between your thumb and index finger, and squeeze.  The chickpea should pop out of the skin.  Place the skin in the bowl and the chickpea in the food processor.
6. Repeat ðŸ˜‰.

Bonus points when you're in a hurry:

Use [noise cancelling headphones](https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/) and run the food processor while you peel and add chickpeas one at a time.  Extra time in food processor = extra fluffy hummus.

#### Why don't you use dried chickpeas?

Not worth the effort.

#### Why don't you use baking soda to facilitate peeling the chickpeas?

I tried it.  Once.  It tasted terrible.  I probably did it wrong.  But that's ok.  Peeling chickpeas individually is an act of love.  Embrace it.

#### 20 minutes?  That's a lot of food processoring.  Why?

To get to creamy and fluffy you've got to whip the hummus.  20 minutes is about right.  10 minutes is the bare minimum, IMO.

#### I live with other human beings.  Food processors are loud.

Run the food processor outside.

#### Why mash the garlic?  Why not just chop it?  Or put it in whole?

I used to do this.  Until I got one batch of hummus where half the garlic managed to avoid the blade entirely.  It was a chunk of garlic.  Floating in some not-tasty-enough hummus.

Mashing it with the salt helps capture the flavor and ensure it gets distributed throughout the hummus.

#### Where's the cumin?

Nowhere.  You don't need it.

#### Why TJ's Organic Chickpeas?

I've tuned the salt level to these chickpeas and I find they're relatively easy to peel.  If you use a different brand make sure to do the math.  The goal is a total of 1618 mg of sodium (roughly).  TJ's Organic Chick Peas has 435 mg of sodium so we need to add 1163 mg - which is 1/2 tsp of salt.  The salt content in different brands can vary substantially.  Do the math to get the right salt level.
