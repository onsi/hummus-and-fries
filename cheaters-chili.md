# Cheater's Chili

Sharing a chili recipe online is preposterous.  There are millions of chili recipes out there.

This one won't win you the blue ribbon at the county fair.  But it's quick, easy, and cheats to amp up the umami and get some smoky flavor.  The longer you can let it simmer, the better.
