# Mana'eesh 

Delicious.  The goal is a crunchy exterior and a chewy interior.  (Adapted from [Taste of Beirut](https://www.tasteofbeirut.com/manooshe-zaatar-on-the-saj-or-bbq-grill/))

# Ingredients
- [ ] 1 heaping teaspoon active dry yeast
- [ ] 1 teaspoon sugar
- [ ] 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour.  1.5 cups whole-wheat flour
- [ ] 2 teaspoons sea salt
- [ ] 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil for dough.  2 additional tablespoons for greasing the bowl.
- [ ] 1.25 cups warm water (110ºF)
- [ ] 3/4 cup [Mid-East Jordanian-style zaatar](https://www.movehalal.com/products/zaatar)
- [ ] 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil for zaatar mixture

## Method

### Make the dough
1. Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/4 cup warm water.  Place in a warm place to proof (a few minutes - just want to see it get thick, opaque and frothy to “prove” the yeast is alive.
2. Place both flours in stand mixer.  Mix with dough hook.
3. Add 3 Tbsp oil, keep mixing.
4. Add proofed yeast, keep mixing.
5. While mixing, gradually add 1 cup warm water.  It should come together and form a ball.
6. Remove dough and place on floured surface.  Sprinkle with couple of Tbsp of flour and knead by hand for 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and not sticky.  Add fingerfuls of flour as you go.
7. Place 2 Tbsp of olive oil in bowl and coat the interior surface.  Add ball of dough, cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour in a warm place free of drafts

### Make the zaatar mixture
1. Combine zaatar and 3/4 cup olive oil in a bowl.  Mix well with a fork.

### Make the mana’eesh
1. Preheat oven to 500ºF.  Place a pan on lower rack to catch drippings.
2. Once dough is risen, place on floured counter.  Roll by hand to shape into a fat sausage and cut into ~14 pieces
3. Roll each piece into a ball, set balls aside covered with a towel.
4. Heat a seasoned (but no additional oil) cast iron pan. On medium high.  To get it hot, then reduce to medium.
5. Take a ball of dough, roll it out with rolling pin to about 5 to 7 inch diameter circle.  The goal is for them to be thin so they cook fast, but not so thin that they turn into a cracker.  ~1-2 mm thickness.
6. Spoon zaatar onto circle.  Spread using back of spoon or fork.  You want about 2 Tbsp of zaatar on each man'ousheh.  Leave a 1/2" border around the edge.
7. Place on cast iron skillet and cover.  Cook for 1 minute.  Bottom should get nice and crusty and brown with blackened spots.
8. Transfer to middle rack of oven.  Cook for an additional 1-1.5 minutes until top dough has set (a zaatar-free region on the edge should not be wet at all - dry to the touch).
9. Take out of oven and set on plate.  Let cool open for 1 minute.  Fold in half and set aside.  (If you don’t let it cool it will crack).

Optimally thick mana’eesh will be cooked through (no doughy interior) but will be pliable enough to fold in half without cracking).

Once you get rolling you can get into a rhythm where you have one cooling, while another bakes in the oven, while another fries on the pan, while you are shaping the dough and putting the zaatar on the other.  You effectively get to the point where you are making one man’ooshe a minute.
