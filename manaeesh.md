# Mana'eesh 

Delicious.  The goal is a crunchy exterior and a chewy interior.  (Adapted from [Taste of Beirut](https://www.tasteofbeirut.com/manooshe-zaatar-on-the-saj-or-bbq-grill/))

Using a pizza stone is essential.

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 heaping teaspoon active dry yeast
- [ ] 1 teaspoon sugar
- [ ] 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour.  1.5 cups whole-wheat flour
- [ ] 2 teaspoons sea salt
- [ ] 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil for dough.  2 additional tablespoons for greasing the bowl.
- [ ] 1.25 cups warm water (110ºF)
- [ ] 3/4 cup [Mid-East Jordanian-style zaatar](https://www.movehalal.com/products/zaatar)
- [ ] 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil for zaatar mixture

## Method

### Make the dough
1. Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/4 cup warm water.  Place in a warm place to proof (a few minutes - just want to see it get thick, opaque and frothy to “prove” the yeast is alive.
2. Place both flours in stand mixer.  Mix with dough hook.
3. Add 3 Tbsp oil, keep mixing.
4. Add proofed yeast, keep mixing.
5. While mixing, gradually add 1 cup warm water.  It should come together and form a ball.
6. Remove dough and place on floured surface.  Sprinkle with couple of Tbsp of flour and knead by hand for 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and not sticky.  Add fingerfuls of flour as you go.
7. Place 2 Tbsp of olive oil in bowl and coat the interior surface.  Add ball of dough, cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour in a warm place free of drafts

### Make the zaatar mixture
1. Combine zaatar and 3/4 cup olive oil in a bowl.  Mix well with a fork.

### Make the mana’eesh
1. Place pizza stone in oven and preheat to 500ºF.
2. Once dough is risen, place on floured counter.  Roll by hand to shape into a fat sausage and cut into ~14 pieces
3. Roll each piece into a ball, set balls aside covered with a towel.
5. Take a ball of dough, roll it out with rolling pin to about 5 to 7 inch diameter circle.  The goal is for them to be thin so they cook fast, but not so thin that they turn into a cracker.  ~1/4" thickness.
6. Spoon zaatar onto circle.  Spread using back of spoon or fork.  You want about 2 Tbsp of zaatar on each man'ousheh.  Leave a 1/2" border around the edge.
7. Transfer to pizza dough.  Cook for 4-6 minutes.  The bottom should  get nice and crusty and brown with blackened spots.
8. Take of out oven and set on plate.  Let cool open for 1 minute.  Fold in half and set aside.

Optimally thick mana’eesh will be cooked through (no doughy interior) but will be pliable enough to fold in half without cracking).
