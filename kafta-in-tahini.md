## Method

### Kafta

1. Fry pine nuts and garlic in oil over medium-high heat.  Stir occasionally and keep an eye on them - the pine nuts can burn quickly.  You want them to get golden brown and have a nutty scent.  Place on paper-towel lined plate.
2. In a large mixing bowl combine diced onion, tomato paste, red pepper paste, seven spice blend, and salt.  Mix together well with a fork.
3. In a pestle and mortar, mash up pine nuts and garlic into a fine paste.
4. Add parsley pine nut/garlic paste and mash some more.  The parsley will eventually break down and join the paste.  Alternatively, finely dice the parsley.
5. Add parsley/garlic/pine nut paste to the mixing bowl.  Mix well.
6. Add ground beef and mix until well incorporated.  I use my hands.
7. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
8. With your hands form individual discs (think hockey puck, but not quite as flat) of the meat mixture.  These are about 1.5-2” in diameter and about 1/2” thick.  I get ~28 discs from 1lb of ground beef but your results may vary and that’s ok.
9. Broil on hi on top rack in oven for 5-7 minutes (keep an eye on them after 5 minutes - you want a bit of charring but don’t go overboard).
10. Flip kafta discs and broil for another 3-5 minutes until browned on the other side.  If by some quirk in the laws of physics you haven’t hit the kill temperature of 165ºF keep broiling until you do.
11.  Remove from oven and set oven temperature to 375ºF.

### Tahini sauce

You can start this process while the Kafta is broiling.

1. Fry up onions in oil until soft (about 7 minutes - no need to caramelize).
2. Add salt, water and lemon juice and stir to combine.
3. Gradually add tahini and stir.  It might split but that’s ok, it’ll come back together just keep stirring.
4. Continue stirring and heat until just boiling, then turn the heat down and simmer for ~5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

### Bring it all together

1. Transfer kafta to 9x13 pyrex
2. Pour tahini/onion sauce - do this gradually and try to distribute the onions evenly.  You should have just enough sauce to almost cover the kafta.
3. Bake at 375ºF for 10-15 minutes, until bubbling.

## FAQ

#### Seven spice blend?

You can either buy the premade blend (which, frankly, is superior to most recipes I’ve tried).  Or look something up online and make your own blend.  Seven spice is a rich and earthy Lebanese blend that combines fall spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves) with more savory spices (cumin, coriander, black pepper).  That fall + savory combo is distinctly Lebanese and very yum.
