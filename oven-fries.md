# Oven Fries

I love french fries.  But I do not like deep-frying things.  I make these oven-fries all the time.  They are deliciously crunchy thanks to the cornmeal + corn starch while staying soft in the middle.  And they actually reheat just fine in a toaster oven unlike conventional fries.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 10 medium-sized yukon gold potatoes.  Cleaned, peels on.
- [ ] 1 tablespoon sugar 
- [ ] 1/4 cup avocado oil
- [ ] 2 tablespoons cornmeal
- [ ] 1 tablespoon corn starch
- [ ] 3/4 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/4 tsp black pepper
- [ ] 1 tsp garlic powder
- [ ] 1 tsp onion powder
- [ ] 1 tsp smoked paprika
- [ ] 1/2 tsp oregano (optional)
- [ ] 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes or 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
- [ ] 1 Tbsp fresh grated parmesan (optional)

## Method

1. Cut potatoes into sticks.  I prefer 1/2" thick sticks but thinner or thicker will do.
1. Place potatoes in colander and sprinkle 1 Tbsp sugar, swishing as you go to evenly coat the potatoes.
1. Let the potatoes sit for 20-30 minutes. They should lose a lot of liqud.  Pat them dry and place them in a mixing bowl. 
1. Preheat the oven to 425F.
1. Cover potatoes with oil and toss to coat.
1. Combine all other ingredients in a small bowl and mix well.
1. Add dry mixture to potatoes gradually while continuously tossing.  Make sure all potatoes are coated evenly.
1. Spread potatoes onto a parchment-paper-lined baking sheet in a single layer (a little overlap is ok).
1. Bake for 30-40 minutes.  Start checking them at 20 minutes.  If you haven't distributed them evenly some will burn.  That's ok.  You can flip them half-way through if you'd like, but I don't bother.

Serve these with [hummus](hummus.md) and/or [burgers](burgers.md).

## FAQ

#### Wat.  Sugar?

Yeah so the sugar does two things:

1. Helps extract liquid from the potatoes.  Dryer potatoes = more "fry-like" and less "mashed-potato-like"
2. It promotes crispiness and browning thanks to the [Maillard reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction).

#### Why no deep-fry?

These are healthier, easier, and - most importantly - they don't turn to mush after you refrigerate them.  You can actually enjoy them cold and they reheat *great* in a toaster oven.
