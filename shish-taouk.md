Tastiest grilled chicken ever.  Traditionally made with skewers, I prefer to grill the chunks of chicken separately so I can get more even browning.  Make sure to just hit 165ºF and not overcook the chicken!

Reserving and cooking down the marinade is key here.  Adds back a ton of flavor and moisture to the chicken.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 lbs chicken breast, cut into 1-2" cubes
- [ ] 1/3 cup avocado oil

- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon all-spice
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- [ ] 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- [ ] 1/2 cup greek yogurt

## Method

### Marinate the chicken

1. Combine avocado oil and lemon juice in a large bowl or tupperware.
2. Crush garlic with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a [mortar and pestle](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=wooden+mortar+and+pestle&crid=1BUF1A6X31XDC&sprefix=wooden+mortar+and+pestl%2Caps%2C126&ref=nb_sb_noss_2).  Add to oil mixture and mix well.

### Grill the chicken
1. Oil grates and preheat grill to 450ºF.
2. Place chicken chunks on grill.  And **reserve marinade**.
3. Grill for 3-4 minutes per side until chicken is browned and reaches 165ºF.  Use a meat thermometer to check and keep an eye on the smaller pieces.
4. While chicken is grilling, place marinade in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
5. Place cooked chicken in a bowl and pour marinade over it.  Toss to coat.
