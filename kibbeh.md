# Kibbeh

The Lebanese national dish (because... that's a thing).  This recipe is adapted from Anissa Helou's "Lebanese Cuisine" cookbook.  Can also be made with ground lamb for a _much_ richer dish.

## Ingredients

### For the stuffing

- [ ] 6 Tbsp butter
- [ ] 1/3 cup pine nuts
- [ ] One large red onion (finely chopped)
- [ ] 1/2 lb 90% ground beef
- [ ] 2 tsp cinnamon
- [ ] 2 tsp allspice
- [ ] 1/2 tsp finely ground black pepper
- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt

### For the bottom and top layers

- [ ] One medium red onion (cut into 8 large chunks)
- [ ] 1.25 lb 90% ground beef
- [ ] 1 cup fine bulgur
- [ ] 2 tsp cinnamon
- [ ] 2 tsp allspice
- [ ] 1/2 tsp finely ground black peppers
- [ ] 3/4 tsp salt
- [ ] ~1-2 Tbsp butter 


## Method

### Prepare the stuffing

1. Melt the butter over medium heat.  Add pine nuts stirring occasionally.  Keep an eye on them - the goal is to fry them until they brown and have a nutty smell.  But they can quickly burn if you aren't careful.  Remove them with a slotted spoon (preserving melted butter) and set aside on a paper towel.
2. Saute onions in butter until soft.
3. Add ground beef and cook until done.
4. Take off heat.  Add pine nuts and all the spices and salt.  Mix well.  Set aside.

### Prepare the outer layers

1. Place onion in a food processor.  Blend until a fine puree.
2. Add spices and salt.  Blend to combine.
3. Gradually add raw beef while running the blender.  The goal is to incorporate well.
4. Transfer meat and onion mixture to a mixing bowl.
5. Place bulgure in a fine sieve and rinse with water.  Make sure to saturate the bulgur and user your hands to then drain out the water.
6. Mix meat mixture and burgul.  The best way to do this is with your hands.  Mix until well combined - it should have a paste-like consistency.

### Construct

1. Grease a 9x13 pyrex pan with butter.
2. Using half the raw meat and onion mixture, lay down the bottom layer.  This should cover the entirety of the pan right up to and including the edge.  You should have a ~1/2 rise at the edge.  The best way to do this to grab a ~2-3 inch ball of the mixture and squash it into a patty in your hands.  Then layer the patty down, filling gaps as you go.  Some folks like to have a mixing bowl filled with ice water near by to dip their hands in as they go.  The water helps the meat not stick to your hands.
3. Once the bottom layer is laid down, spoon the stuffing mixture evenly over the entire layer.
4. Now the tricky part.  Lay a top layer on top of the stuffing layer.  Proceed as before, squashing balls of meat between your hands and then laying down patties and filling gaps.  The layer is around ~3/8-1/2" thick.

### Decorate

1. This is optional, but traditional.  Using a sharp paring knife score the top layer.  You can lay down a grid like pattern or really whatever you'd like.  Traditional patterns include squares and diamonds.  You can have thicker+deeper lines delineating slices (~3x4 slices in the pan) and thinner+shallower lines adding additional detail.

### Bake

1. Add a small piece of butter (~1/8-1/4 tsp) on top of each slice.  No need to spread it.  It'll melt in as the kibbeh bakes.
2. Bake uncovered in an oven preheated to 350ยบ.  Bake for 15-20 minutes.  The kibbeh should shrink slightly and the meat should be just done.

Serve with [hummus](#hummus) and/or labneh.  Goes great with tabouleh.
